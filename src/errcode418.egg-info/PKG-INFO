        ## About this Project
        This is a joke package, made to amuse my friends in Java Lab. If you want to use it or improve on it, please go ahead.
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        import nicetime
        
        // converts minutes up to 69 in the previous hour. Continues with minute 10 in current hour. 
        
        t = nicetime.time(3,9,12)
        t.print() // should print 02:69:12
        
        // works for seconds as well!
        
        t = nicetime.time(4,10,9)
        t.print() // should print 03:69:69
        
        ```
